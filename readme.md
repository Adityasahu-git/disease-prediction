# Disease Prediction Using AI/ML Supervised Learning

## Description

Disease prediction using AI/ML and supervised learning involves training models on labeled medical data to identify patterns and predict health conditions. Algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests analyze features such as symptoms, test results, or images to forecast diseases. This approach enables early diagnosis and supports personalized healthcare interventions by providing accurate and timely predictions.

## Features

- Predict diseases based on user input symptoms
- Utilizes supervised machine learning models such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
- Trained on labeled medical datasets
- Web-based interface for ease of access
- Supports early diagnosis and personalized recommendations

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optional enhancements)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **ML Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Deployment**: Render
